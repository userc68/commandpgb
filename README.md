-Hello there, I just came up with this new application, commandline progressbar.
-Took a couple hours, but i did it.
-Progressbar.cpp is basically the tutorial for using / customizing it.
-The No Comment version is NCProgressbar.cpp.
-I ask simply that if you use this tool, include me in the projects credits as 
   -javakotlinuser@gmail.com. // Progressbar Tool-
-I should make a file extension for customizing this bar, maybe tomorrow.
-btw its slow with vscode themes
